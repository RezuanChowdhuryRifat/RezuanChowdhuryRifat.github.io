  <h2>👨🏻‍💻 About Me</h2>
  <p>I recently graduated from North South University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering.</p>
  <p>🔬 My research areas encompass the application of Machine learning (ML) in medical image analysis and the advancement of ML through Quantum computing.</p>
  <p>📚 I am excited to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I hope to collaborate with leading researchers and contribute to advancements in ML.</p>

  <h2>👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience</h2>
  <p>I worked as an <strong> undergrad research assistant</strong> at North South University under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Abdul Qayum on <strong>Quantum Machine Learning</strong>, where I developed an improved dressed quantum neural network for breast cancer classification. Our work has been accepted at the 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2024).</p>

  <h2>💻 Projects</h2>
 
  
  <br>
  <h3>Bad Root Canal Detection</h3>
  <p>We implemented an auto tooth segmentation system powered by <strong>YOLOv5</strong> and the <strong>Segment 
    Anything Model</strong>. The object detection model was trained to detect bad root canals, which were later used 
    as a prompt for the segmentation model to generate the segmentation mask. <a href="https://github.com/RezuanChowdhuryRifat/Bad-root-canal-detection/tree/main">

    <h3>Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 using Graph Neural Network</h3>
    <p>
      I successfully replicated the results of the research paper titled 
      <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02353-5">
        "Drug repurposing for COVID-19 using graph neural network and harmonizing multiple evidence"</a> 
      by following the original methodologies and using Graph Neural Network. Afterwards, we utilized a quantum training layer as a drug ranking model. <a href="https://github.com/RezuanChowdhuryRifat/Drug-Repurposing">
