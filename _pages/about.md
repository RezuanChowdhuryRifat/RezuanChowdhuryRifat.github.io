  <h2>👨🏻‍💻 About Me</h2>
  <p>I recently graduated from North South University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering.</p>
  <p>🔬 My research areas encompass the application of Machine learning (ML) in medical image analysis and the advancement of ML through Quantum computing.</p>
  <p>📚 I am excited to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I hope to collaborate with leading researchers and contribute to advancements in ML.</p>

  <h2>👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience</h2>
  <p>I worked as a <strong>Student Researcher</strong> at North South University under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Abdul Qayum on <strong>Quantum Machine Learning</strong>, where I developed a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model for breast cancer classification. Our work has been submitted to the 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2024).</p>

  <h2>💻 Projects</h2>
  <h3>Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 using Graph Neural Network</h3>
  <p>We implemented an auto tooth segmentation system powered by <strong>YOLOv7</strong> and the <strong>Segment Anything Model</strong>. The object detection model was trained to detect bad root canals, which were later used as a prompt for the segmentation model to generate the segmentation mask.</p>
