<!-- ![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"} -->
👨🏻‍💻 I recently graduated from North South University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering. 

🔬 My research areas encompass the application of machine learning (ML) in medical image analysis and the advancement of ML through Quantum computing.

📚 I am excited to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I hope to collaborate with leading researchers and contribute to advancements in ML. 



# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
