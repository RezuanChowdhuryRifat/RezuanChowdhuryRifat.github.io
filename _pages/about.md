👨🏻‍💻 I recently graduated from North South University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering. 

🔬 My research areas encompass the application of Machine learning (ML) in medical image analysis and the advancement of ML through Quantum computing.

📚 I am excited to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I hope to collaborate with leading researchers and contribute to advancements in ML. 




# 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
I worked as a **Student Researcher** at North South University under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Abdul Qayum on **Quantum Machine Learning**, where I developed a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model for breast cancer classification. Our work has been submitted to the 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2024). 



# 💻 Projects

## Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 using Graph Neural Network



## Bad Root Canal Detection
We implemented an auto tooth segmentation system powered by **YOLOv7** and the **Segment Anything Model**. The object detection model was trained to detect bad root canals, which were later used as a prompt for the segmentation model to generate the segmentation mask.
