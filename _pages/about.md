## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
<div style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa;">
I recently graduated from North South University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering.

My research areas encompass the application of Machine learning (ML) in medical image analysis and the advancement of ML through Quantum computing.

I am excited to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I hope to collaborate with leading researchers and contribute to advancements in ML.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
<div style="box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #ffffff;">
I worked as a **Student Researcher** at North South University under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Abdul Qayum on **Quantum Machine Learning**, where I developed a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model for breast cancer classification. Our work has been submitted to the 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2024).

We implemented an auto tooth segmentation system powered by **YOLOv7** and the **Segment Anything Model**. The object detection model was trained to detect bad root canals, which were later used as a prompt for the segmentation model to generate the segmentation mask.
